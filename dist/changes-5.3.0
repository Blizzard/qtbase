   in Qt 5.3, and will be removed in Qt 5.4. The platform is currently
   not tested, and most likely has issues that are not fully documented.

QtWidgets
---------

QtCore
------

 - Added QSignalBlocker, a RAII-style wrapper around
   QObject::blockSignals().

QtGui
-----

 - Added setSwapInterval() to QSurfaceFormat. Platforms that support
   setting the swap interval are now defaulting to the value of 1,
   meaning vsync is enabled.

QtSql
-----

 - QSqlQuery::isNull(field) now correctly returns true for "no such field".
 - QSqlQuery::isNull(fieldname) is a new overload.
 - QSQLITE: Empty database name now opens in-memory database.
 - QSqlError: Now handles alphanumeric error codes. Used by QPSQL.
              Old numeric code is deprecated.
