On Ubuntu 11.10 icccm1 is replaced by icccm4 and xcb-render-util is not available:
libxcb1 libxcb1-dev libx11-xcb1 libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-image0 libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-shm0 libxcb-shm0-dev libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-sync0 libxcb-sync0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxrender-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-glx0-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev
The packages for xcb-render-util can be installed manually from http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/libxcb-render-util0 and http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/libxcb-render-util0-dev

On Ubuntu 12.04 icccm1 is replaced by icccm4 and xcb-render-util can be installed automatically:
libxcb1 libxcb1-dev libx11-xcb1 libx11-xcb-dev libxcb-keysyms1 libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-image0 libxcb-image0-dev libxcb-shm0 libxcb-shm0-dev libxcb-icccm4 libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-sync0 libxcb-sync0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libxrender-dev libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-render-util0 libxcb-render-util0-dev libxcb-glx0-dev libxcb-xinerama0-dev


On Fedora, the following packages are required:
libxcb libxcb-devel libXrender libXrender-devel xcb-util-wm xcb-util-wm-devel xcb-util xcb-util-devel xcb-util-image xcb-util-image-devel xcb-util-keysyms xcb-util-keysyms-devel

REDUCING RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES

The '-qt-xcb' configure option can be used to get rid of most xcb- dependencies. Only libxcb will
still be linked dynamically, since it will be most likely be pulled in via other dependencies anyway.
This should allow for binaries that are portable across most modern Linux distributions.

PACKAGE VERSION REQUIREMENTS

When using touch input via XInput 2.2 or higher, there is a potential issue on systems that ship with
a libXi older than 1.7.4. This is because XIAllowTouchEvents can deadlock with libXi 1.7.3 and earlier.
When touch events are never received, this is not an issue, so plain mouse/keyboard systems are not affected.
See http://lists.x.org/archives/xorg-devel/2014-July/043059.html for details on the libXi patch.
Qt versions before 5.8 attempted to recognize this scenario based on the pkg-config package version and skip
the call. This has been removed starting from 5.8 since relying on pkg-config package versions is unsafe given
that Qt must also support systems with limited or incomplete pkg-config setups.
