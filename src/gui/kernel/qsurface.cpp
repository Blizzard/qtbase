    \brief The QSurface class is an abstraction of renderable surfaces in Qt.

    The size of the surface is accessible with the size() function. The rendering
    specific attributes of the surface are accessible through the format() function.
 */


/*!
    \enum QSurface::SurfaceClass

    The SurfaceClass enum describes the actual subclass of the surface.

    \value Window The surface is an instance of QWindow.
    \value Offscreen The surface is an instance of QOffscreenSurface.
 */


/*!
    \enum QSurface::SurfaceType

    The SurfaceType enum describes what type of surface this is.

    \value RasterSurface The surface is is composed of pixels and can be rendered to using
    a software rasterizer like Qt's raster paint engine.
    \value OpenGLSurface The surface is an OpenGL compatible surface and can be used
    in conjunction with QOpenGLContext.
    \value RasterGLSurface The surface can be rendered to using a software rasterizer,
    and also supports OpenGL. This surface type is intended for internal Qt use, and
    requires the use of private API.
