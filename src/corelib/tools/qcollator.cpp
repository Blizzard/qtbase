    \class QCollator

    \brief The QCollator class compares strings according to a localized collation algorithm.

    \since 5.2

    \reentrant
    \ingroup i18n
    \ingroup string-processing
    \ingroup shared

    QCollator is initialized with a QLocale and an optional collation strategy. It tries to
    initialize the collator with the specified values. The collator can then be used to compare
    and sort strings in a locale dependent fashion.

    A QCollator object can be used together with template based sorting algorithms such as std::sort
    to sort a list of QStrings.

    In addition to the locale and collation strategy, several optional flags can be set that influence
    the result of the collation.

    By default this mode is off.

    \note On Windows, this functionality makes use of the \l{ICU} library. If Qt was
    compiled without ICU support, it falls back to code using native Windows API,
    which only works from Windows 7 onwards. On older versions of Windows, it will not work
    and a warning will be emitted at runtime.

    Returns a sortKey for \a string.

    Creating the sort key is usually somewhat slower, than using the compare()

    a whole list of strings), it's usually faster to create the sort keys for each
    string and then sort using the keys.
