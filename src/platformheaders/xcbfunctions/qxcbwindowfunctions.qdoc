    \note There is no binary compatibility guarantee for this class,
    meaning that an application using it is only guaranteed to work with the Qt
    version it was developed against.

    This is the typedef for the function returned by QGuiApplication::platformFunction when passed setWmWindowTypeIdentifier.
*/

/*!
    \fn QByteArray QXcbWindowFunctions::setWmWindowTypeIdentifier()

    This function returns the byte array that can be used to query
    QGuiApplication::platformFunction to retrieve the SetWmWindowType function.

    \fn void QXcbWindowFunctions::setWmWindowType(QWindow *window, WmWindowType type)

    This is a convenience function that can be used directly instead of resolving the function pointer.
